# Airsend Device Configuration Example
# Place this file at /config/airsend.yaml in your Home Assistant installation
# 
# This file defines your Airsend-controlled devices for bidirectional reception.
# When a physical remote is pressed, the addon will update the corresponding
# Home Assistant entity automatically.

# Example configuration for Somfy RTS shutters
# Replace the values with your actual device information

devices:
  Volet séjour baie vitrée:
    # Device identifier (used to create entity_id)
    id: 67706
    # Protocol type (4099 = Somfy RTS)
    type: 4099
    # Wait for command completion
    wait: true
    # Connection URL with password and IP (reference from secrets.yaml)
    spurl: !secret spurl
    # Channel configuration
    channel:
      # Channel ID from your Airsend configuration
      id: 13920
      # Source ID (remote control identifier)
      source: 567765
      # Enable reception for this device (set to true to receive remote events)
      listen: true

  Volet chambre principale:
    id: 67707
    type: 4099
    wait: true
    spurl: !secret spurl  # Same Airsend device
    channel:
      id: 13921
      source: 567766
      listen: false  # Only one channel can listen at a time per device

  Volet cuisine:
    id: 67708
    type: 4099
    wait: true
    # Direct spurl for IPv6 example
    spurl: "sp://mypassword@fe80::1234:5678:90ab:cdef"
    channel:
      id: 13922
      source: 567767
      listen: false

  Store terrasse:
    id: 67709
    type: 4099
    wait: false  # Don't wait for completion
    spurl: !secret spurl_2  # Second Airsend device
    channel:
      id: 13923
      source: 567768
      listen: true  # This device can listen since it's a different Airsend

# Notes:
# 1. Entity IDs will be created as: cover.airsend_[device_name_normalized]
#    Example: "Volet séjour baie vitrée" becomes "cover.airsend_volet_sejour_baie_vitree"
#
# 2. Only devices with "listen: true" will have reception enabled
#
# 3. The Airsend can only listen to one channel at a time per device
#
# 4. Remote button presses will update the entity state:
#    - UP command → state: open
#    - DOWN command → state: closed
#    - STOP command → state: stopped
#    - MY command → state: preset
#
# 5. Each state change also fires a custom event: "airsend_remote_pressed"
#    You can use this event in automations
#
# 6. Make sure the channel IDs match your actual Airsend configuration
#    You can find these in the Airsend web interface or documentation
